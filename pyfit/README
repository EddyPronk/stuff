This is a work in progress based on PyFIT 0.8a2.
The intend is to merge this code back into PyFIT.

Design goals/ideas :
* A table is a list of lists.
* Flow mode for DoFixtures part of design.
* Eliminate need for _typeDict
* uses a XML parser (minidom)
* unit tests use wiki syntax instead of HTML.
* most unit tests run without HTML dependency.
* uses and integrates with Twisted.

What works so far? (in about 700 lines of Python):
* A FitServer which works with Fitnesse.
* ColumnFixtures and RowFixtures.
* simple DoFixtures.
* Setup in suites.
